            <h2>About the Game</h2>
            <p>Trepenta is a strategic card game for 2-6 players that combines hand management with tactical field placement. The goal is to form sets and runs while minimizing points over five rounds.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The core game can be played as-is, or altered with house rules to suit your group's preferences. We've offered a variety of optional rules to enhance and customize your gameplay experience.</p>

                    <li><strong>Draw</strong> one card (from discard pile or draw pile)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Use complete standard decks—no need to remove any suits or cards</li>

                    <li>More decks = easier to form sets and runs (more casual)</li>
                    <li>Fewer decks = more challenging to complete hands (more strategic)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select the appropriate number of decks based on player count (see table above)</li>
                    <li>Players agree on who will deal first. After each round, the dealer rotates to the left</li>
                    <li>The dealer shuffles and deals each player two separate piles of 5 cards each</li>
                    <li>The dealer places one card face-up to start the discard pile</li>
                    <li>Each player chooses one pile to place face-down in a line (left to right) as their <strong>field</strong>, and keeps the other pile as their <strong>hand</strong></li>
                    <li>Each player rolls their die and places it to the left of their field cards</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Understanding the Field & Die</h3>
                <p>The five face-down cards in your field serve two important purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A reserve of cards to exchange with your hand</li>
                    <li>A mechanism to trigger the end of the round</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Field Card Values</h4>
                <p>Your die roll determines the value of your field cards from left to right. Each position represents a sequential card value.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you roll a 3, your field positions are valued: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (left to right).</p>
                
                <h4>How to Exchange Field Cards</h4>
                <p>On your turn, you may optionally exchange one card from your hand with a face-down field card, but only if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You hold a card that matches that position's value</li>
                    <li>The field card at that position is still face-down</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> With a field valued 1-2-3-4-5, if you hold a card with value 5 and the 5th position is face-down, you may place your 5 face-up in that position and take the face-down card into your hand.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>How to Play</h3>
                <p>The player to the left of the dealer goes first. Play continues clockwise.</p>
                
                <h4>Turn Sequence</h4>
                <p>On each turn, you must perform these actions in order:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Draw:</strong> Take the top card from either the discard pile or the draw pile (required)</li>
                    <li><strong>Exchange:</strong> Optionally exchange one card from your hand with a face-down field card (if you have a matching value)</li>
                    <li><strong>Discard:</strong> Place one card from your hand face-up onto the discard pile (required)</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Your hand always contains exactly 5 cards at the start and end of each turn.</p>
                
                <h4>Ending the Round</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>When any player exchanges their fifth and final field card (all five positions now face-up and in correct order), each other player takes one more turn, then the round ends and scoring begins.</li>
                    <li>If the draw pile becomes completely depleted during any player's turn, that player completes their turn and the round ends immediately.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Scoring</h3>
                <p>At the end of each round, all players reveal their hands. Only the cards in your hand count for scoring—field cards do not count.</p>
                
                <h4>Sets and Runs</h4>
                <p>Cards that form valid sets or runs score <strong>0 points</strong>. All other cards score their face value.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Set:</strong> Three or more cards of the same rank (suits don't matter)<br>
                    <em>Example: 7 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, 7 of Spades</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Run:</strong> Three or more consecutive cards of the same suit<br>
                    <em>Example: 4-5-6 of Diamonds</em></li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Run Wrapping Rules</h4>
                <p>Runs may wrap around the Ace boundary <strong>once</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Valid:</strong> Queen-King-Ace or Ace-2-3</li>
                    <li><strong>Invalid:</strong> Queen-King-Ace-2 (wraps twice)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Card Point Values</h4>
                <table class="scoring-table">
                    <thead>

                <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
                <p>Trepenta is played for exactly <strong>five rounds</strong>. After the fifth round, players add up their total score from all rounds.</p>
                <p>The player with the <strong>lowest total score wins</strong>.</p>
                <p>In the event of a tie, all tied players share the victory—there is no tie-breaking mechanism.</p>
